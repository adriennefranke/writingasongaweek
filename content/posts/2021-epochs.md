Here's how I'm defining the weeks for next year. I decided on this because the weeks start on Mondays and end with a weekend. I'll have plenty of time to get ideas hashed out during the week and on the weekend, I can spend the days fine tuning and finishing them up. Completing a song will be a great way to end a weekend!

I'll be sure to keep this table up to date with my progress.

Because I know habits are cemented if there's some type of reward, ✨reward weeks✨ are denoted by an asterick. When I get through those weeks, I'll probably get myself something fun like a new piece of gear or a record or something.
