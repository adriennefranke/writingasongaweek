I think it's a good idea to lay down some basic rules here. *What will push me to be better and what will make it easier for me to accomplish this goal?* I want a nice balance.

1. The song must be recorded in some way, but it does not need to be mixed or mastered.
2. The song should be at least 2 minutes long.
3. Ideas, chord progressions, melodies, beats, lyrics, etc can be used even if they were written before 2021.
4. I can write songs with other people.
5. More than one song can be written in a week.
6. A song doesn't need to be written each week exactly, but there must be 52 songs written by December 31, 2021.
