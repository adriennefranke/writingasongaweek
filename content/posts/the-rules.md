When I first decided to write one song a week for an entire year, I thought it would be good to lay sound basic ground rules. What were the rules that were going to push me to be better and what were the rules that were going to make a bit easier for me to accomplish actually accomplish this goal? I wanted a nice balance. 

1. The song must be recorded in some way, but it does not need to be mixed or mastered.
2. The song should be at least 2 minutes long.
3. Ideas, chord progressions, melodies, beats, lyrics, etc can be used even if they were written before 2021.
4. I can write songs with other people.
5. More than one song can be written in a week.
6. A song doesn't need to be written each week exactly, but there must be 52 songs written by December 31, 2021.
