[Dexed](https://asb2m10.github.io/dexed/) is a wonderful little synth. It's completely open source and free to download, and is a great tool for digging deep in FM synthesis. I highly recommend trying it out!

This week's song is inspired by Vangelis. Nothing too complex here - it's a chill 2 minute piece. I used Dexed for all the synths and a Volca Beats for the drums.
