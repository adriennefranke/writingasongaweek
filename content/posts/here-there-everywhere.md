![Here, There and Everywhere by Geoff Emerick book and a cup of coffee](herethereandeverywhere.jpg)

I read this book looking for inspiration from one of my favorite bands and their recording engineer, Geoff Emerick. Emerick's responsible for the cutting edge, fantastic engineering on some of my favorite Beatles records (Revolver, Sgt Pepper, and Abbey Road).
