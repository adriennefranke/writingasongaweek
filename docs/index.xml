      <description>I think it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to lay down some basic rules here. What will push me to be better and what will make it easier for me to accomplish this goal? I want a nice balance.
 The song must be recorded in some way, but it does not need to be mixed or mastered. The song should be at least 2 minutes long. Ideas, chord progressions, melodies, beats, lyrics, etc can be used even if they were written before 2021.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Donâ€™t wait for inspiration. It comes while one is working.&amp;rdquo; ~Henri Matisse I can&amp;rsquo;t remember where or when I got the idea to write a song a week for an entire year, but it was sometime in November or December of this year. I was just about to finish my 2020 New Year&amp;rsquo;s Resolution (to read one book a month) and was starting to toss ideas around of what I could do in 2021.</description>
