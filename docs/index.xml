      <description>&lt;p&gt;Considering I spent over 10 hours writing, this week was definitely the most challenging so far. I’ve mostly been working through a backlog of songs so I’m &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/take-something-off-the-shelf-and-dust-it-off/#removing-obstacles&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;not starting from scratch every time.&lt;/a&gt; But the main issue this week was that the snippet I had recorded previously was incredibly out of time so I had to re-record a lot of parts to make it all fit together. And it’s still not perfect.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Writing for the Weeks Ahead</title>

      <description>Sometimes during a week, I’ll spend an evening pulling together random ideas for the weeks ahead. It could be a chord progression, it could be a drum beat, it could be a synth line. I’ll start an Ableton or Logic project, get the snippet down and drop it into an “Ideas” folder that I keep. I don’t do much else. I don’t try to figure out where the song will go next or what genre I want it to be.</description>

      <title>If Geddy Lee Can Sing, So Can I (And So Can You)</title>

      <description>Stuck (Demo) by Adrienne Franke Week 2 ✅
This is the second song I&amp;rsquo;ve ever released where I&amp;rsquo;m singing. Singing is something entirely out of my comfort zone, but it&amp;rsquo;s also something I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to start doing for a while. Now, I&amp;rsquo;m making myself do it more. Growth happens outside the comfort zone, right?
Find Confidence However You Can Whenever I get anxious or self conscious about singing, I just think of Geddy Lee.</description>

      <title>Take Something Off the Shelf and Dust It Off</title>

      <description>Week 1 is complete! I started the week off by working on a Beatles-inspired song, but mid-week I changed plans and decided to finish a song with a longtime collaborator of mine. We originally wrote this song in October 2017. Over three years ago! We wrote it for a one-off show here in Nashville, and intended to do more but never got around to it. But this week, we wrapped it up!</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s how I&amp;rsquo;m defining the weeks for next year. I decided on this because the weeks start on Mondays and end with a weekend. I&amp;rsquo;ll have plenty of time to get ideas hashed out during the week and on the weekend, I can spend the days fine tuning and finishing them up. Completing a song will be a great way to end a weekend!
I&amp;rsquo;ll be sure to keep this table up to date with my progress.</description>

      <title>Snippets from &#39;Here, There and Everywhere: My Life Recording the Music of The Beatles&#39; by Geoff Emerick</title>

      <description>I read this book looking for inspiration from one of my favorite bands and their recording engineer, Geoff Emerick. Emerick&amp;rsquo;s responsible for the cutting edge, fantastic engineering on some of my favorite Beatles records: Revolver, Sgt Pepper, and Abbey Road. I highly recommend the book. It was an insightful page turner. Here are a few snippets that stuck with me as I read.
&amp;ldquo;It was because of those very limitations that we were put on the spot, forced to make creative decisions every step of the way.</description>

      <title>Writing a Song a Week: Rules of the Game</title>
      <link>https://writingasongaweek.com/posts/the-rules/</link>

      <description>I think it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to lay down some basic rules here. What will push me to be better and what will make it easier for me to accomplish this goal? I want a nice balance.
 The song must be recorded in some way, but it does not need to be mixed or mastered. The song should be at least 2 minutes long. Ideas, chord progressions, melodies, beats, lyrics, etc can be used even if they were written before 2021.</description>

      <title>Writing a Song a Week: Why?</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Don’t wait for inspiration. It comes while one is working.&amp;rdquo; ~Henri Matisse I can&amp;rsquo;t remember where or when I got the idea to write a song a week for an entire year, but it was sometime in November or December of this year. I was just about to finish my 2020 New Year&amp;rsquo;s Resolution (to read one book a month) and was starting to toss ideas around of what I could do in 2021.</description>
