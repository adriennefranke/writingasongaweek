      <description>The song must be recorded in some way, but it does not need to be mixed or mastered. The song should be at least 2 minutes long. Ideas, chord progressions, melodies, beats, lyrics, etc can be used even if they were written before 2021. More than one song can be written in a week. A song doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to be written each week exactly, but there must be 52 songs written by December 31, 2021.</description>
