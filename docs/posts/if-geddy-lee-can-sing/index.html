<p>Week 2 ‚úÖ</p>
<p>This is the second song I&rsquo;ve ever released where I&rsquo;m singing. Singing is something entirely out of my comfort zone, but it&rsquo;s also something I&rsquo;ve been wanting to start doing for a while. Now, I&rsquo;m making myself do it more. Growth happens outside the comfort zone, right?</p>
<h2 id="find-confidence-however-you-can">Find Confidence However You Can</h2>
<p>Whenever I get anxious or self conscious about singing, I just think of Geddy Lee. When I first heard him sing, I actually found it quite hilarious and wondered how anyone could enjoy it. It&rsquo;s high pitched and (somewhat annoyingly) theatrical. I even read online somewhere that someone described it as &ldquo;like a cat being chased out the door with a blowtorch up its ass.&rdquo; But the more I listened to Rush, the more I realized that Geddy Lee just fucking owned it. I grew to like his voice, understanding that it fits perfectly with the 70s prog riffs and nerdy lyrics. Rush is not Rush without Geddy Lee. I also think about John Lennon and Bob Dylan. Both of them objectively have nasally voices&hellip; but no one really cares about that. They sang their songs and everybody loved them for it. I just need to own my voice and work to develop my style over time.</p>
<h2 id="letting-things-music-art-go">Letting Things (Music, Art) Go</h2>
<p>When I wrote the bridge of this song, I had this vision that it would be a growing cascade of layered synths, guitar parts, oohs &amp; ahhs, etc. I wanted it to be big with lots of components and panning, covering the full range of frequencies. Lots of delay, chorus and reverb. Well, that didn&rsquo;t happen. I ran out of steam and lost interest. I&rsquo;ve let go of that idea for now. I may come back to it if I ever re-record this song, but I may not. You don&rsquo;t have to run with every single idea you have and you&rsquo;re allowed to scrap things before you even start them. There are no rules.</p>
<h2 id="time-spent-this-week">Time Spent This Week</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m still using a time tracker. Surprised that I spent over 3 hours mixing! It didn&rsquo;t feel like it.</p>
