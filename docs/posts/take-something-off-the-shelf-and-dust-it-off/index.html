            <p>Week 1 is complete! I started the week off by working on a Beatles-inspired song, but mid-week I changed plans and decided to finish a song with a longtime collaborator of mine. We originally wrote this song in October 2017. Over three years ago! We wrote it for a one-off show here in Nashville, and intended to do more but never got around to it. But this week, we wrapped it up! It has layers and layers of synthesizers, a TR-707 drumbeat, and some guitar with a DOD Rubberneck delay. I‚Äôm really proud of how it turned out. Due to COVID, we sent each other zipped Ableton files back and forth. I&rsquo;ve never collaborated in this way before and while it felt a little weird, it worked out just fine. I can‚Äôt share it just yet but as soon as it‚Äôs released I‚Äôll post it here.</p>
<h2 id="removing-obstacles">Removing Obstacles</h2>
<p>I currently have around 20 unfinished songs. <a href="https://writingasongaweek.com/posts/the-rules/" target="_blank">(Yes, these song snippets are fair game for this challenge!)</a> Next week, I&rsquo;m planning to pick one of them up off the shelf, dust it off and finish it. One of the best ways to build a habit is to remove obstacles so it becomes easy to do what you want to do. You want getting started to feel effortless. Working on a song that‚Äôs half finished is removing an obstacle: starting from scratch. It&rsquo;s daunting to stare at an empty session. So, take something off the shelf and dust it off. Whether it&rsquo;s a piece of art, a piece of music, or some writing - see what you can make of it, what you can add, and if you can make something new.</p>
<h2 id="tracking-my-time">Tracking My Time</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying something out with this where I keep track of what I&rsquo;m working on and how much time I spend. When I start working on a session I &ldquo;clock in&rdquo; with what instrument I&rsquo;m working on and then &ldquo;clock out&rdquo; when I&rsquo;m finished. Since it&rsquo;s early days, I just have a simple report of how much time I spent this week, so it&rsquo;s not much, but it is interesting! I did not feel like I spent over 3 hours working on a few basslines, but the data doesn&rsquo;t lie. It looks like I spent about 1 hour a day on songwriting. Not too much of a time commitment so far.</p>
