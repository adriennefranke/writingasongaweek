<p>I can&rsquo;t remember where or when I got the idea to write a song a week for an entire year, but it was sometime in November or December of this year. I was just about to finish my 2020 New Year&rsquo;s Resolution (to read one book a month) and was starting to toss ideas around of what I could do in 2021. One thing was for sure: I knew that I would be home a lot, probably at least until mid-year, because of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been longing to get back into music. When I started at Belmont University as an undergrad, I loved music. I mean, I lived and breathed music (as I know most Belmont newcomers do). But shortly after arriving at the dorms, I became dismayed about it all. I learned about the commercial side of the business (which was frankly boring to me), I met people that seemed to only care about becoming famous or only wanted to know you if they could gain something from knowing you, and I generally found it hard to find people that shared the same taste in music as me. Also you couldn&rsquo;t play music in the dorms! And since I wasn&rsquo;t in the College of Music, I couldn&rsquo;t personally reserve any practice space. As time went on in college, I started to work a lot more and additionally, I changed my major and general career path. I still continued to go to lots of shows and listen to tons of music, but as far as actually creating music, that unfortunately didn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>But now that I&rsquo;m a few years beyond graduation, I finally feel ready to get back into music <strong>on my own terms</strong>. I&rsquo;m far enough away from the music industry now that I don&rsquo;t feel any weird, uncomfortable pressure to fit into a mold, nor do I feel the need to impress anyone. I&rsquo;m at the point where I&rsquo;m writing for myself because it&rsquo;s fun and I enjoy it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s clear I want to create more music, but why a song a week? I&rsquo;ve realized that if I don&rsquo;t have an external deadline, I just won&rsquo;t really put much time towards something. When <a href="https://adriennefranke.bandcamp.com/album/falling-leaves-original-motion-picture-soundtrack-live-at-the-belcourt-theater" target="_blank">I wrote and performed a score for a silent film at The Belcourt</a> in 2018, I found out about that opportunity only one month before the show. I came home from work every day and wrote the music. And guess what? I came up with 4 songs and I ended up releasing them. Were they perfect? No. Were they great? I don&rsquo;t think so. But they were done, and done is better than perfect. This is my way of getting closer and closer to &ldquo;done&rdquo;. No more 45 second song snippets here.</p>
<h1 id="i-write-only-when-inspiration-strikes-fortunately-it-strikes-every-morning-at-nine-oclock-sharp-somerset-maugham">‚ÄúI write only when inspiration strikes. Fortunately it strikes every morning at nine o‚Äôclock sharp.‚Äù ~Somerset Maugham</h1>
<p>If I write 52 songs, there&rsquo;s bound to be a few good ones in the mix. Lately, I&rsquo;ve been feeling a creative burst and a strong desire to make something&hellip; to spend a year creating and then have a whole collection at the end. This project is my permission to myself to create without restriction, to write endlessly until the week turns and I have to move on to the next one. I hope that by the end, aside from a 52 song collection, I&rsquo;ll be more a more confident musician and maybe - just maybe - I will have written a vocal melody or two.</p>
