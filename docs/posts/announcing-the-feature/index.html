            <p>I‚Äôm really excited to announce a new project with a long time collaborator and great friend of mine, <a href="https://www.evemaret.com/" target="_blank">Eve Maret</a>. We‚Äôve been making music together for about 10 years now! From high school jazz band to an angsty punk rock band to now, our work together has spanned genres and we‚Äôve had a ton of fun doing it.</p>
<p>Our new project, <a href="https://thefeaturemusic.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">The Feature</a>, combines swirling synths, drippy delayed guitar, grooving basslines, and danceable beats. What started as a one off show in October 2017 has turned into a more concrete project. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we‚Äôve been exchanging Ableton projects back and forth as we work on our first full length album.</p>
<p>Our first song Space Freeway will be released on February 12th and we‚Äôre so excited to share. Here‚Äôs the artwork I created and Eve edited.</p>

<p><a href="https://writingasongaweek.com/posts/2021-epochs/" target="_blank">The song I wrote for Week 04</a> is potentially going to be another song for The Feature, which is why I can‚Äôt share much about it just yet. It‚Äôs been different to collaborate with someone remotely and it takes longer to finish a song when you can‚Äôt get into the studio and there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that! I am respecting the process that is creating music with someone while we‚Äôre in a pandemic. We exchange notes about the direction we want the song to head in, we take advice of the other seriously, and speak out when something just doesn‚Äôt work. We aren‚Äôt indecisive about things. It can be challenging to not have immediate feedback, but I just remember that this is a totally different way of creating. It‚Äôs much harder to feed off of each other and we can‚Äôt jam to get ideas out. That being said, creative constraints can result in something really awesome. I think you‚Äôll like what we‚Äôve created.</p>
