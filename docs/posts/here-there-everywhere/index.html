<p>I read this book looking for inspiration from one of my favorite bands and their recording engineer, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoff_Emerick" target="_blank">Geoff Emerick</a>. Emerick&rsquo;s responsible for the cutting edge, fantastic engineering on some of my favorite Beatles records: Revolver, Sgt Pepper, and Abbey Road. <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/here-there-and-everywhere-my-life-recording-the-music-of-the-beatles/9781592402694" target="_blank">I highly recommend the book</a>. It was an insightful page turner. Here are a few snippets that stuck with me as I read.</p>
<h1 id="it-was-because-of-those-very-limitations-that-we-were-put-on-the-spot-forced-to-make-creative-decisions-every-step-of-the-way">&ldquo;It was because of those very limitations that we were put on the spot, forced to make creative decisions every step of the way.&rdquo;</h1>
<p>If you didn&rsquo;t know (I didn&rsquo;t), Sgt Pepper&rsquo;s Lonely Hearts Club Band was recorded on a 4 track! Both Geoff Emerick and George Martin have said that if the album had been recorded on a 16 track or even an 8 track, it wouldn&rsquo;t have been nearly as good. I&rsquo;ve certainly experienced situations where limitations can lead to an even greater amount of creativity and I&rsquo;m excited to work this philosophy into my writing. Some ideas I&rsquo;ve come up with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Limiting myself to only 4 tracks in my DAW to replicate the feel of a 4 track</li>
<li>Restricting the instruments available</li>
<li>Using just a couple mics to record the entire song, regardless of the instrumentation</li>
</ul>
<p>A 4 track similar to what The Beatles used to record Sgt Pepper:

<h1 id="youve-got-to-start-somewhere-even-if-you-make-mistakes-along-the-way">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to start somewhere, even if you make mistakes along the way.&rdquo;</h1>
<p>This quote is in reference to the somewhat unsuccessful Magical Mystery Tour movie. It didn&rsquo;t get great reviews! I underlined this quote as a reminder that it&rsquo;s okay to create lackluster work right off the bat - in fact it&rsquo;s pretty much a guarantee that this will happen. Even Sir Paul McCartney has missteps. Have you ever heard Temporary Secretary?</p>
<h1 id="the-hits-down-there-not-in-here">&ldquo;The hit&rsquo;s down there, not in here.&rdquo;</h1>
<p>The Beatles recorded most of their work in Studio Two at Abbey Road and the control room is up a flight of steps, far away from the actual room where the musicians are when they&rsquo;re recording. So when Geoff Emerick says that the hit&rsquo;s &ldquo;down there&rdquo;, he&rsquo;s referring to fact that the <em>words and music</em> are the most important component - engineering can only take a song so far. Ultimately, it all starts and ends with the song. I want to keep that in mind: spend more time on the song rather than the knobs or faders.</p>
