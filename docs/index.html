        <p>Considering I spent over 10 hours writing, this week was definitely the most challenging so far. I‚Äôve mostly been working through a backlog of songs so I‚Äôm <a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/take-something-off-the-shelf-and-dust-it-off/#removing-obstacles" target="_blank">not starting from scratch every time.</a> But the main issue this week was that the snippet I had recorded previously was incredibly out of time so I had to re-record a lot of parts to make it all fit together. And it‚Äôs still not perfect.</p>

        Sometimes during a week, I‚Äôll spend an evening pulling together random ideas for the weeks ahead. It could be a chord progression, it could be a drum beat, it could be a synth line. I‚Äôll start an Ableton or Logic project, get the snippet down and drop it into an ‚ÄúIdeas‚Äù folder that I keep. I don‚Äôt do much else. I don‚Äôt try to figure out where the song will go next or what genre I want it to be.

        Stuck (Demo) by Adrienne Franke Week 2 ‚úÖ
This is the second song I&rsquo;ve ever released where I&rsquo;m singing. Singing is something entirely out of my comfort zone, but it&rsquo;s also something I&rsquo;ve been wanting to start doing for a while. Now, I&rsquo;m making myself do it more. Growth happens outside the comfort zone, right?
Find Confidence However You Can Whenever I get anxious or self conscious about singing, I just think of Geddy Lee.

        Week 1 is complete! I started the week off by working on a Beatles-inspired song, but mid-week I changed plans and decided to finish a song with a longtime collaborator of mine. We originally wrote this song in October 2017. Over three years ago! We wrote it for a one-off show here in Nashville, and intended to do more but never got around to it. But this week, we wrapped it up!

        Here&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;m defining the weeks for next year. I decided on this because the weeks start on Mondays and end with a weekend. I&rsquo;ll have plenty of time to get ideas hashed out during the week and on the weekend, I can spend the days fine tuning and finishing them up. Completing a song will be a great way to end a weekend!
I&rsquo;ll be sure to keep this table up to date with my progress.
