        Here&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;m defining the weeks for next year. I decided on this because the weeks start on Mondays and end with a weekend. I&rsquo;ll have plenty of time to get ideas hashed out during the week and on the weekend, I can spend the days fine tuning and finishing them up. Completing a song will be a great way to end a weekend!
I&rsquo;ll be sure to keep this table up to date with my progress.

        I read this book looking for inspiration from one of my favorite bands and their recording engineer, Geoff Emerick. Emerick&rsquo;s responsible for the cutting edge, fantastic engineering on some of my favorite Beatles records: Revolver, Sgt Pepper, and Abbey Road. I highly recommend the book. It was an insightful page turner. Here are a few snippets that stuck with me as I read.
&ldquo;It was because of those very limitations that we were put on the spot, forced to make creative decisions every step of the way.

        I think it&rsquo;s a good idea to lay down some basic rules here. What will push me to be better and what will make it easier for me to accomplish this goal? I want a nice balance.
 The song must be recorded in some way, but it does not need to be mixed or mastered. The song should be at least 2 minutes long. Ideas, chord progressions, melodies, beats, lyrics, etc can be used even if they were written before 2021.

        &ldquo;Donâ€™t wait for inspiration. It comes while one is working.&rdquo; ~Henri Matisse I can&rsquo;t remember where or when I got the idea to write a song a week for an entire year, but it was sometime in November or December of this year. I was just about to finish my 2020 New Year&rsquo;s Resolution (to read one book a month) and was starting to toss ideas around of what I could do in 2021.
