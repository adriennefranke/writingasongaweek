      <description>When I first decided to write one song a week for an entire year, I thought it would be good to lay down some basic rules. What will push me to be better and what will make it easier for me to accomplish this goal? I wanted a nice balance.
 The song must be recorded in some way, but it does not need to be mixed or mastered. The song should be at least 2 minutes long.</description>
