      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s how I&amp;rsquo;m defining the weeks for next year. I decided on this because the weeks start on Mondays and end with a weekend. I&amp;rsquo;ll have plenty of time to get ideas hashed out during the week and on the weekend, I can spend the days fine tuning and finishing them up. Completing a song will be a great way to end a weekend!
I&amp;rsquo;ll be sure to keep this table up to date with my progress.</description>

      <description>I think it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to lay down some basic rules here. What will push me to be better and what will make it easier for me to accomplish this goal? I want a nice balance.
 The song must be recorded in some way, but it does not need to be mixed or mastered. The song should be at least 2 minutes long. Ideas, chord progressions, melodies, beats, lyrics, etc can be used even if they were written before 2021.</description>
