      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m really excited to announce a new project with a long time collaborator and great friend of mine, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.evemaret.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Eve Maret&lt;/a&gt;. We’ve been making music together for about 10 years now! From high school jazz band to an angsty punk rock band to now, our work together has spanned genres and we’ve had a ton of fun doing it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
