      <description>&lt;p&gt;Considering I spent over 10 hours writing, this week was definitely the most challenging so far. I’ve mostly been working through a backlog of songs so I’m &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/take-something-off-the-shelf-and-dust-it-off/#removing-obstacles&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;not starting from scratch every time.&lt;/a&gt; But the main issue this week was that the snippet I had recorded previously was incredibly out of time so I had to re-record a lot of parts to make it all fit together. And it’s still not perfect.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Sometimes during a week, I’ll spend an evening pulling together random ideas for the weeks ahead. It could be a chord progression, it could be a drum beat, it could be a synth line. I’ll start an Ableton or Logic project, get the snippet down and drop it into an “Ideas” folder that I keep. I don’t do much else. I don’t try to figure out where the song will go next or what genre I want it to be.</description>

      <description>Stuck (Demo) by Adrienne Franke Week 2 ✅
This is the second song I&amp;rsquo;ve ever released where I&amp;rsquo;m singing. Singing is something entirely out of my comfort zone, but it&amp;rsquo;s also something I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to start doing for a while. Now, I&amp;rsquo;m making myself do it more. Growth happens outside the comfort zone, right?
Find Confidence However You Can Whenever I get anxious or self conscious about singing, I just think of Geddy Lee.</description>

      <description>Week 1 is complete! I started the week off by working on a Beatles-inspired song, but mid-week I changed plans and decided to finish a song with a longtime collaborator of mine. We originally wrote this song in October 2017. Over three years ago! We wrote it for a one-off show here in Nashville, and intended to do more but never got around to it. But this week, we wrapped it up!</description>
